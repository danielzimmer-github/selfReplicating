# selfReplicating
This is a simple program that I adapted from a forgotten paper about selfreplicating code. 
I had to make a python script to create the char array holding the code that is copied. 
In addition, I find it frustratingly amusing that it is nessicary to compile two programs
to test a single program. Which coincidentally a behavior that is exploited in compilers
since they often have to compile themselves, a sort of recursive compliation that can can
be used to hide triggers that can cause the compiled code to behave maliciously.
